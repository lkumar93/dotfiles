Gedit Python checker

A simple gedit plugin for checking python files.
Currently checks:
  - pep8 conformance with the pep8 module
  - basic checks using pyflakes

There is also git pre-commit hook in tools-git directory which validates PEP8/pylint
code in similar way as this plugin with two differences:
1. it validates all committed .py files
2. empty ending line is not validated
3. blame for each line is checked and is reported only if the person is 
on given list


Installation

You will need both the pep8 and pyflakes modules, available from pypi.

```
  pip install pyflakes
  pip install pep8
```
